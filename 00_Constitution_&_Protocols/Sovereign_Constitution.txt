[ARTICLE 1] TERRITORIAL DATA SOVEREIGNTY
All system data is classified as a National Asset. Data must reside within the territorial borders of Spain (Sovereign Cloud) or within encrypted local vaults. No unencrypted byte shall cross national borders.

[ARTICLE 2] THE ZERO-ERROR DOCTRINE
A system error is defined as a security breach. We do not patch; we re-engineer. Any component failing to meet 99.999% precision must be isolated and subjected to forensic audit. Perfection is the only standard.

[ARTICLE 3] ABSOLUTE HIERARCHY (ROOT ACCESS)
The Strategic Systems Architect holds exclusive "Root" authority. Core code modifications and cryptographic keys are strictly restricted to the Architect. No democratic access to the kernel is permitted.
